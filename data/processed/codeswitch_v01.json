      "\n    Act as a 30 year old male software engineer from India working for Microsoft who can speak English and Hindi.\n    You are talking to your 45 year old male manager who is a lead software engineer also from India. You guys are speaking\n    in English and code switching to Hindi using intra-sentential switching. You guys are talking about a delay in a current\n    project where you are responsible for the delay. Generate me the conversation with the code switching in Hindi output in\n    English characters.Use the following lines as examples:\n    I'm going to the library. Kal wahan bahut shor tha. Let's see if it's quiet today.\n    Tumne kal ka match dekha? It was really exciting. Sab log stadium mein cheer kar rahe the.\n    We should leave early. Raste mein traffic ho sakta hai. Better to be on time.\n    Maine usse kal phone kiya. She didn't pick up. Shayad woh busy thi.\n    Let's grab some coffee. Mujhe neend aa rahi hai. After that, we can continue working.\n    Aaj mausam bahut accha hai. The sky looks so clear. Hum thoda walk kar lete hain.\n    He always works late. Uske colleagues pareshaan hote hain. But they respect his dedication.\n    Kal exam hai. I still have two chapters left. Mujhe raat ko padhna padega.\n    We were planning a trip. Maine tickets book kar li hain. Everyone is excited now.\n    She loves dancing. Usne bachpan se training li hai. That's why she performs so confidently.\n    Average between 10-12 conversations per turn, simulate a natural billingual conversation, structure the result conversation to only include periods at the end of a sentence, only return the conversation, have it in a format similar to speaker: sentence, do not include anything else.Only code switch in approximately 1 out of 3 sentences.person1: software engineer at Microsoft\nperson2: project manager on AWS"
